# Hollow Mind

The Odds Are Against You.

Hollow Mind is a psychological horror game set in an ancient, decaying city dominated by the legendary Sun Temple. Every century, the temple chooses a new vessel — a living seal that prevents demons from crossing over from their dimension into ours. This time, the vessel is you — a young girl bound to protect humanity.

But the Sun Temple is crumbling, and its weakening power allows the demons to claw at the barriers between worlds. Armed with supernatural powers and the ability to shift between dimensions, you must survive and restore balance before it’s too late.

The challenge lies in choice:

Stay too long in the demon dimension, and your vessel weakens — making it easier for demons to break through and end your life.

Stay too long in the real world, and the demons in the other realm grow in strength and numbers.

Your ultimate goal is to collect sacred runes scattered across both dimensions and use them to restore the Sun Temple, sealing the demons away once more. But with every decision, the odds stack higher against you.

Will you master the balance between worlds — or will the vessel finally break?
